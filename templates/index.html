<h3>
SchistoTarget is a machine-learning (SVM) classifier for the identification of immunoreactive proteins. 
</h3>
<h4>
The classifier uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to discriminate between two categories of proteins. Recently, it has been demonstrated that such a amino acid feature based classifier can significantly increase prediction accuracy. The protien SVM predictions are highly valuable for identifying genes important for host-parasite interaction and the discovery of novel drug and vaccine targets.
